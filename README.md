Problem Description:    
For this project, we selected to make a data model for a gym that offers many services to its customers. When we began building this data model, we looked at it from the gym ownerâ€™s perspective; what information would a gym owner or manager like to know about their business? After a few brainstorming sessions and rough drafts, we quickly realized that capturing the entire business had made our model far too complicated leading us to focus only on customer interactions with the gym. As a result, we turned our attention to what entities a customer should expect or be likely to purchase as a member of a gym. Our goal is to track the customer and their interactions with the gym. This includes payments for membership, merchandise, lockers, and specific workout classes. Additionally, we suggested that the model include a way to track customers using specific services like a sauna, spa, or massage. Furthermore, we wanted customers to be able to rent out and reserve specific appointment times for these services. Now, owners can track which of the gym locations provide certain services and how many customers are using these services. This allows owners owning multiple gyms to compare one location to another, and track the usage data from existing services. Furthermore, the management or the corporate side of the company can closely monitor individual locations to evaluate the success of each gym. Overall, our data model allows the gym to monitor any and all purchases or appointments that may exist with each customer giving management the capability to closely observe the cash flow of each gym from merchandising expenses to membership and workout class fees.
